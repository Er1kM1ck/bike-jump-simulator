A dirt jump simulator for mtb, dj, and bmx
A step beyond the old and somewhat popular non graphed jump calculator at https://trailism.com/jump-design/
A means to help diggers dig, shape, pack, and ride
I took inspiration from skijump.info, and others trying to incorporate Equivalent Fall Heights
More features to come I hope
