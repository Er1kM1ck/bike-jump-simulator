# Bike Jump Simulator

Interactive Streamlit app to simulate projectile motion of a bike and rider,
including wind drag, ramp geometry, and impact-force safety analysis. 
This simulator is step beyond the old and somewhat popular (now defunct) non-graphed 
jump calculator at https://trailism.com/jump-design/

The goal is to help diggers dig, shape, pack, and ride more safely, lowering (not eliminating) serious 
injuries on jumps. I took inspiration from skijump.info, and others trying to incorporate Equivalent Fall Heights. 
This is an open source Humanist venture. More feature development to come I hope.


## Run locally
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
